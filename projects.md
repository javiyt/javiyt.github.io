[YExtend](https://github.com/javiyt/YExtend)
Based on [YAF framework](https://github.com/laruence/php-yaf) I have created an extension to deal with the framework easily, mostly you can find here an extension to build ajax controllers, so you can send to the user the view in json format. Sadly it is not documented.

## Javascript Projects

It is not a project itself, it should be used only for educational purposes, I created a backbone application for a workshop where people learned to deal with backbone.

The same as above, it is a workshop I did where people created a Bug Tracker using Backbone.
